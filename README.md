# E-Signature API Test task

All the development was made by Vladlen Mikhalov [vladowski@gmail.com](mailto://vladowski@gmail.com)

## How to launch the project locally
This is a test task, so the easiest way would be to init Sail locally. 
Make sure you have Docker up and running and let's go.

### First, clone the project:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:vladowski/e-signature-test.git
cd e-signature-test
```

### Run `launch.sh` from the project directory
It's just a list of command for Sail routine
```bash
chmod +x launch.sh
./launch.sh
```

Then import Postman Collection `E-Signature API.postman_collection.json` and Postman Environment `E-Signature API Env.postman_environment.json` to Postman and enjoy testing. **May the Force be with you** 

## P.S.
API Documentation would be accessible from `http://localhost/api/documentation#/`
